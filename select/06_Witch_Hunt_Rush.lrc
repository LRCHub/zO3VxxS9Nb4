[01:11.79] The night is black without a moon
[01:17.90] The air is thick and still
[01:23.75] The vigilantes gather on
[01:29.65] The lonely torchlit hill
[01:41.65] 
[01:48.55] Features distorted in the flickering light
[01:52.55] Faces are twisted and grotesque
[01:56.38] Silent and stern in the sweltering night
[02:00.42] The mob moves like demons possessed
[02:04.32] Quiet in conscience, calm in their right
[02:08.14] Confident their ways are best
[02:22.64] 
[02:13.09] Oh-oh-oh
[02:16.33] Oh
[02:17.33] 
[02:35.70] The righteous rise with burning eyes
[02:42.62] Of hatred and ill will
[02:46.83] Madmen fed on fear and lies
[02:52.58] To beat and burn and kill
[03:05.08] 
[03:02.47] They say there are strangers who threaten us
[03:09.35] Our immigrants and infidels
[03:15.19] They say there is strangeness too dangerous
[03:21.83] In our theaters and bookstore shelves
[03:28.27] Those who know what's best for us
[03:33.86] Must rise and save us from ourselves
[03:51.86] 
[03:54.85] Quick to judge, quick to anger
[03:59.83] Slow to understand
[04:03.85] Ignorance and prejudice
[04:08.64] And fear walk hand in hand
